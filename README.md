# Prerequisites


Two different API's are being used in this app:

1. [Random Famous Quotes API (through RapidAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/andruxnet/api/random-famous-quotes)
2. [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Configure API keys

Those API's can only be accessed with the right API key, so it is required to have these API keys configured, before starting the app.
There are two options to get this done.

### Option 1: Add .env file with the keys
Add a file called `.env.development.local` in the root of the project, with these contents:

```text
REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY=<key>
REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=<key>
```

where `<key>` should be replaced with the API key.

### Option 2: Add API keys to the localStorage

Add two entries to your localStorage, with the right keys.
The entries should be called `REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY`.


## Node.js environment

To run the app, Node.js is required.
More info about Node.js could be found at [their website](https://nodejs.org/).


# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
